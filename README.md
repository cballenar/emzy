#Emzy
Emzy is a PX to EM calculator that allows you to keep track of multiple elements and output the final results as css. 

## Todo
- Store configuration (save and load as json?)
- Better icons
- Accept custom properties, not just font-size?

## Source
- I saw this project done at riddle.pl/emcalc and decided to make a similar version. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be available anymore.
